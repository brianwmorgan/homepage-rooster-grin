## Project Notes

1. I built this project in React because it's the frontend framework I have the most familiarity with. For formatting and styling, I augmented the CSS with Bootstrap because it has a grid system and a carousel component, both of which were requirements for this project.
2. I struggled a bit with finding a consistent approach for element spacing. I kind of settled on tinkering with `vw` for the padding and margins of most elements because I recently read a blog that argued that `vw` is the best unit for responsivity. However, perhaps I would have been better served by incorporating more media queries and `flexbox` properties. Also, I had some trouble formatting the data-target markers for the carousel-indicators to be responsive, so I still need to iron out that bug. I'm eager for feedback so I can hone a more confident approach on my next project.
3. This was my first time implementing animations, and it was super fun! I was surprised at how easy the `fade-in` and `pulse` effects were to add - the documentation I found online was very clear and helpful. I'll be sure to incorporate more animations in future projects. Also, I took some time to watch a couple of tutorials on utilizing a BEM method along with SASS and managed to refactor one of my sections' CSS into an SCSS file accordingly. Overall, this was a great exercise for practicing my design skills and highlighted some areas I can learn more about and get better at going forward. Good stuff!
